== Disclaimer ==

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without making
any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you can try out
the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall mechanism is
provided).

== Requirements ==

The DSMW extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki
(cf: http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki)
(in the LocalSettings.php file, set the memory limit
from 20 to 50M --> ini_set( 'memory_limit', '50M' )) and
SimpleForms extensions
(cf: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Simple_Forms).
For more details, see those extensions'own
installation requirements.

The PHP extension GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) must be installed (or activated)
(also available on Windows platforms since PHP5.1.0) 

Important: If you want to run the DSMW tests, you must make a dump of your 
database immediatly (before using DSMW), for more details, see the readme file
in the tests directory [wikipath]/extensions/p2pExtension/tests.


== Installation ==

'''Remark:'''  Follow these different points carefully for a successful
               installation and do not copy-paste from the example.

(1) Download the zip file and extract it
    Paste the folder named p2pExtension into the Mediawiki extension folder
    "[wikipath]/extensions/".

(2) Edit LocalSettings.php in the root of your MediaWiki installation,
    and add the following lines near the bottom but BEFORE THE LINES THAT
    ACTIVATE SEMANTIC MEDIAWIKI(cf. requirements):

  require_once "$IP/extensions/p2pExtension/p2pExtension.php";
  $wgGroupPermissions['*']['ArticleAdminPage']       = true;
  require_once("$IP/extensions/p2pExtension/specialPage/ArticleAdminPage.php" );


'''Remark:'''  The admin user of the wiki must be "WikiSysop" and
the password "admin", if it isn't so, you have to modify those credentials
in the "BasicBot.php" file.
"[wikipath]/extensions/p2pExtension/bot/BasicBot.php" (line 79-80)
These two lines:
if (!defined('USERNAME')){	define('USERNAME','WikiSysop');}
if (!defined('PASSWORD')){	define('PASSWORD','admin');}

(3) Creation of new tables in the Mediawiki database:
        Create the database tables, executing the script on your MySQL
        administration tool.
        Substitute `wikidb` for the name of your database.
        The script can be found in the file: /p2pExtension/db/addedTables.sql

(4) The "cache" directory should exist and be writeable by the server
    ([wikipath]/extensions/p2pExtension/bot/cache)

(5) Edit the LocalSettings.php and add these lines AFTER THE P2PEXTENSION
    ACTIVATION (see point (2)) and BEFORE THE LINES THAT ACTIVATE SEMANTIC
    MEDIAWIKI:

    $wgLogo = "{$wgScriptPath}/extensions/p2pExtension/files/Logo.jpeg";
    require_once "$IP/extensions/p2pExtension/files/DSMWSettingsInc.inc";

    and these line after THE LINES THAT ACTIVATE SEMANTIC MEDIAWIKI:

    global $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks;
    $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks = $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks + array(
		PATCH => true,
		PUSHFEED => true,
                PULLFEED => true,
                CHANGESET => true
                );


== Example: LocalSettings.php ==

The end of this file should look like this:


require_once "$IP/extensions/p2pExtension/p2pExtension.php"
$wgGroupPermissions['*']['ArticleAdminPage']       = true;//sysop
require_once("$IP/extensions/p2pExtension/specialPage/ArticleAdminPage.php" );

$wgLogo = "{$wgScriptPath}/extensions/p2pExtension/files/Logo.jpeg";

require_once "$IP/extensions/p2pExtension/files/DSMWSettingsInc.inc";

include_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php");
enableSemantics($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']);
global $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks;
$smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks = $smwgNamespacesWithSemanticLinks + array(
		PATCH => true,
		PUSHFEED => true,
        PULLFEED => true,
        CHANGESET => true
	);

== Disclaimer ==

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without making
any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you can try out
the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall mechanism is
provided).

== Requirements ==

The extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki 1.0 or
greater. For more details, see Semantic MediaWiki's own
installation requirements.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SemanticForms" that contains
    all relevant files. Copy this directory (or extract/download it) to
    "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once('extensions/SemanticForms/includes/SF_Settings.php');

'''Remark:'''  Semantic Forms creates an additional custom namespace, "Form"
(see http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Custom_namespaces). If you have your
own custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter $sfgNamespaceIndex before
including SF_Settings.php. See SF_Settings.php for more details.
